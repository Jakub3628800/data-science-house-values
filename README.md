# data-science-house-values
This is a small (2 week) project for Data Science class. 
The goal was to write a paper based on [GÃ©ron (2017) p. 33-79 project](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb) and discover some additional insights about the dataset.

### housing_prices.ipynb
The notebook is just a short version of the original with some extra parts and visualizations.

### PredictingHousePrices.pdf
The pdf is a paper written to communicate the used methods and discovered findings. It is meant to be short and to the point, communicate insights clearly, make use of visualizations and use references appropriately. The overall goal was to write something that closely resembles a science paper.
